# bad-wolf
USU Hackathon 2017 Game

Created in 36 hours.

# To build and run:
1. Clone both this repo and the bad-wolf-launcher into the same directory (so that the root directories are adjacent).
2. Run build_and_run.(bat|sh). This will build both projects into a folder called build.
3. This script will then run the launcher. To run the launcher after the game is built, run run.(bat|sh) inside the build folder.
